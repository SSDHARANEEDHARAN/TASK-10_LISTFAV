ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Favourite Students Web App | React & TailwindCSS ðŸš€

Iâ€™m excited to share a project Iâ€™ve been working on â€“ a "Favourite Students" Web App built using React and TailwindCSS! This app allows users to view a list of students, add them to their favorites, and toggle between the student list and the list of favorites.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Student List: View a list of students with the ability to mark them as favorites.
Favourite List: Switch between viewing all students and only your favorite students.
Interactive UI: Built using React for dynamic interactions and state management.
TailwindCSS: Used for responsive and modern styling with a clean, sharp design.
Background Video: Added a beautiful sky video background to enhance the user experience.
ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™ve Learned:

React: Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with React, including managing state and handling dynamic user interactions.
TailwindCSS: This project deepened my knowledge of TailwindCSS for rapid, responsive UI development.
Project Structure: I focused on creating a clean and maintainable project structure for scalability.
This project was an exciting opportunity to put my skills to the test, and I look forward to continuing to improve it with more features and optimizations!
